5 macrobenchmarks
- 4 since one takes vastly more time to run
  - remaining data has variance?
  - estimated time to run?
- only those listed on the official webpage
  - others likely outdated and not compatible anyways

- perf_ns or something added in python 3.7
  - so only after this version?

- all that is not a security release (i.e., contain a release for windows)
- did not view earlier release
  - likely incompatible
- last bugfix releases: 3.9.13, 3.8.10, 3.7.9, 3.6.8, 3.5.4, 3.4.4, 3.3.5, 3.2.5, 3.1.4, 3.0.1, 2.7.18, 2.6.6, 2.5.4, 2.4.4, 2.3.5, 2.2.3, 2.1.3, 2.0.1

- all the versions
- eliminate those that are beyond bugfix versions
- starts of new formats

- compatibility - auto install?
- data/info

         # possible problem: msi instead of amd64 msi when there are newer versions?
         # averted: going down the list?


- some needs precisely 15 runs
